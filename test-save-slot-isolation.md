# Save Slot Isolation Test

This document outlines a test procedure to verify that save slot isolation is working correctly and that there are no infinite loops in the code.

## Test Procedure

### Initial Check

1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Verify that the page loads without any errors in the console
5. Verify that there are no "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

### Save Slot Testing

1. Clear all save slots:
   - Click "Continue Game" on the main menu
   - Click "Clear All Save Games" button
   - Confirm the action

2. Create a new character in save slot 1:
   - Click "Start New Game" on the main menu
   - Select save slot 1
   - Enter a character name (e.g., "Wizard1")
   - Complete character creation

3. Return to the main menu:
   - Click the "Return to Main Menu" button in the wizard's study

4. Create a new character in save slot 2:
   - Click "Start New Game" on the main menu
   - Select save slot 2
   - Enter a different character name (e.g., "Wizard2")
   - Complete character creation

5. Play a battle with the character in save slot 2:
   - Click "Start Duel" in the wizard's study
   - Complete the battle until you win and level up to level 2

6. Return to the main menu:
   - Click "Return to Main Menu" button after the battle

7. Verify save slot isolation:
   - Click "Continue Game" on the main menu
   - Verify that save slot 1 shows "Wizard1" at level 1
   - Verify that save slot 2 shows "Wizard2" at level 2
   - Select save slot 1
   - Verify that the wizard's study shows "Wizard1" at level 1
   - Return to the main menu
   - Click "Continue Game" again
   - Select save slot 2
   - Verify that the wizard's study shows "Wizard2" at level 2

## Expected Results

- Save slot 1 should always show "Wizard1" at level 1
- Save slot 2 should always show "Wizard2" at level 2
- The wizard's study should show the correct character data for the selected save slot

## Console Logs to Check

Check the browser console for the following logs:

1. When selecting a save slot:
   ```
   MainMenu: Save slot X with UUID [uuid] selected
   MainMenu: Loading existing game
   Page: Continuing game from slot X with UUID [uuid]
   Successfully loaded save slot X with UUID [uuid]
   Loaded player: [name], Level [level]
   Current save slot UUID set to: [uuid]
   ```

2. When entering the wizard's study:
   ```
   WizardStudy: Component mounted
   WizardStudy: Using save slot X with UUID [uuid]
   WizardStudy: Player name: [name], Level: [level]
   ```

## Error Checking

During the entire test process, keep an eye on the browser console for any errors or warnings, especially:

1. "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors, which indicate an infinite loop in the React component updates
2. "Player data mismatch" errors, which indicate that the player data doesn't match the save slot data
3. Any other unexpected errors or warnings

If you see any of these errors, the save slot isolation fix may not be working correctly.

## Changes Made to Fix Infinite Loop Issue

1. In `GameInitializer.tsx`:
   - Removed `gameState` from the dependency array of the useEffect hook to prevent infinite loops
   - Removed the code that was loading save slots and logging save slot information

2. In `MainMenu.tsx`:
   - Split the useEffect hook into two separate hooks: one for loading save slots and one for logging save slot information
   - Added a condition to only log save slot information when the save slot modal is open
   - Moved the state declarations before the useEffect hooks to avoid using variables before they're declared

3. In `WizardStudy.tsx`:
   - Split the useEffect hook into two separate hooks: one for initial mount and one for verifying save slot data
   - Added a condition to only verify save slot data when the component is mounted and a player exists
   - Used more specific dependencies in the useEffect hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders
