i have a browser based game at https://wizards-choice.vercel.app/
Someone suggested i add a donation button of some sort. I'm thinking to the left of the brought to you by mageworks.studio on the main menu on desktop and below it on mobile. It should probably open a modal or new screen like how the How to Play button does. Oh maybe i should put the support the devs button below how to play button and above brought to you by info instead. 
If it opens a new page it gives me room to list options for how to donate, from paypal, cashapp, kofi, patreon, and eventually a merch shop. 
What do you think is best. This way i can open the public deploy of the game up to players donating if they want to help support the development of the game.

​Adding a donation button to your game, Wizard's Choice, is a thoughtful way to invite players to support its ongoing development. Here are some recommendations to effectively implement this feature:​

1. Placement of the Donation Button:

Desktop: Position the "Support the Devs" button below the "How to Play" button and above the "Brought to you by Mageworks.studio" text. This placement ensures a logical flow and maintains visual harmony.​

Mobile: Maintain the same order—placing the "Support the Devs" button between the "How to Play" button and the "Brought to you by Mageworks.studio" text. Ensure the button is easily tappable and responsive on smaller screens.​

2. Button Design:

Visibility: Use a high-contrast color for the donation button to make it stand out from other elements. This draws attention without disrupting the overall design.​

Text: Incorporate a clear call-to-action, such as "Support the Devs" or "Donate Now," to encourage user engagement.​

3. Donation Modal or Page:

Modal vs. New Page: Implementing a modal (a pop-up window) can keep users engaged without navigating them away from the main menu. However, if you anticipate providing extensive information about donation options, a dedicated page might be more suitable.​

Content: Clearly outline the various ways players can contribute, such as PayPal, CashApp, Ko-fi, Patreon, and information about upcoming merchandise. Briefly explain how these contributions will support the game's development to foster a connection with potential donors.​

4. Technical Implementation:

PayPal Integration: To create a PayPal donation button, you can use PayPal's Donate SDK. This allows you to customize the button to match your website's design. For detailed instructions, refer to PayPal's developer guide. ​
Stack Overflow

Custom Buttons: If you prefer to design your own button, you can integrate it with PayPal's donation functionality. A discussion on Stack Overflow provides insights into using the PayPal Donate SDK with custom HTML buttons. ​

5. Best Practices:

Transparency: Communicate how the donations will be used. Players are more likely to contribute if they understand the impact of their support.​

Ease of Use: Ensure the donation process is straightforward, with minimal steps to complete a contribution.​

Mobile Optimization: Confirm that the donation interface is responsive and user-friendly across all devices.​

By thoughtfully integrating a donation feature, you provide players with an opportunity to support Wizard's Choice, fostering a sense of community and investment in the game's future.​

I like the idea of a Support the Devs button. Idk whats best with the modal vs new page question. 
I want to give them options to donate via paypal, cashapp, kofi, as well as sign up at patreon. 
I want to be clear that the donations will go towards keeping the power and internet and hosting bills paid, as well as costs for further development. 
My links are:
https://www.patreon.com/mageworks
https://www.paypal.me/joshuaem
https://cash.app/$magejosh
https://ko-fi.com/magejosh

Can you write me a simple html page withthat info as context that i can give to my coding team.

Certainly! To facilitate user donations via multiple platforms and clearly communicate how the funds will be utilized, you can create a dedicated "Support the Developers" page. Below is a simple HTML template that your development team can use as a foundation:

Instructions for Implementation:

Hosting the Page: Save the above code as an HTML file (e.g., support.html) and host it on your server. Ensure it's accessible via a URL like https://yourdomain.com/support.

Navigation Integration: Add a "Support the Devs" button to your game's main menu:

Desktop: Position the button below the "How to Play" button and above the "Brought to you by Mageworks.studio" text.

Mobile: Maintain the same order for consistency.

Button Functionality: Configure the "Support the Devs" button to open the support.html page. This can be done in two ways:

New Page: Direct the user to the support.html page in the same or a new browser tab.

Modal Window: Load the support.html content within a modal overlay on the current page. This approach keeps users within the game interface. To implement this:

Use JavaScript to create a modal window.

Load the support.html content into the modal using an iframe or AJAX call.

Ensure the modal is responsive and user-friendly on all devices.

Additional Considerations:

Security: Ensure all links use HTTPS to maintain user trust and data integrity.

Responsiveness: Test the support.html page and modal implementation across various devices to guarantee a seamless experience.

Analytics: Consider tracking button clicks and page visits to understand user engagement and optimize the donation process.

By following this approach, you provide players with clear and accessible options to support the game's development, fostering a supportive community around your project.
