### Spell Synergies

Look for spells that work well together:

### Resource Management

- Use equipment that complements your spell selection

## Tips for Success

2. **Know Your Enemy**: Different opponents have different spell preferences
3. **Balance Your Deck**: Include a mix of offensive and defensive spells
4. **Upgrade Strategically**: Focus level-up points on stats that match your playstyle
5. **Experiment**: Try different spell and equipment combinations to find powerful synergies

Good luck, wizard! May your spells be powerful and your strategy sound!
