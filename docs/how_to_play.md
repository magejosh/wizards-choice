#### Market Attacks
Beware when leaving markets! There's a chance you'll be ambushed by thieves and rogues:

- Higher-level markets have a greater chance of ambushes
- When ambushed, you can choose to fight or attempt to flee
- **Fighting**: Engage in a duel with the market attacker
  - Victory rewards you with rare ingredients
  - Defeat results in lost gold
- **Fleeing**: 50% chance to escape safely
  - Successful escape: Return to your wizard's study unharmed
  - Failed escape: Lose a portion of your gold

These ambushes add risk to market visits but provide opportunities for valuable rewards!

## Advanced Strategies

### Difficulty Levels

Enemy AI behavior changes based on difficulty:
- **Easy**: Enemies use their lowest damage spells
- **Normal**: Enemies use random spells
- **Hard**: Enemies use highest damage spells, or healing if health is below 50%

### Spell Synergies

Look for spells that work well together:
- Debuff spells followed by damage spells
- DoT spells combined with defensive spells
- Reaction spells to counter enemy strategies

### Resource Management

- Balance mana usage across turns
- Consider skipping turns to regenerate mana when safe
- Use equipment that complements your spell selection

## Tips for Success

1. **Plan Ahead**: Consider your next few turns, not just the current one
2. **Know Your Enemy**: Different opponents have different spell preferences
3. **Balance Your Deck**: Include a mix of offensive and defensive spells
4. **Upgrade Strategically**: Focus level-up points on stats that match your playstyle
5. **Experiment**: Try different spell and equipment combinations to find powerful synergies

Good luck, wizard! May your spells be powerful and your strategy sound!
