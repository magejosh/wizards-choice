# Player Profile System Implementation

## Overview

The Player Profile System has been implemented as specified in the [Player Profile System Design Document](./player_profile_system.md). This document provides technical details about the implementation, explaining how the various components work together and how to use them in the game.

## System Architecture

The player profile system is built with these key components:

1. **Data Types & Interfaces** - Core data structures for the player profile
2. **State Management** - Context and reducers for managing profile data
3. **UI Components** - React components for displaying profile information
4. **Services** - Logic for achievements and notifications
5. **Data Persistence** - Functionality for saving/loading profile data
6. **Integration with Gameplay** - Event hooks for updating profile during gameplay

```

## Core Data Types

### PlayerStats

Contains all tracked player statistics, including:
- Basic stats (level, health, mana, gold)
- Game progress (chapters, choices, playtime)
- Combat stats (battles won/lost, damage dealt)
- Achievement and title counts
- Collection stats (items, spells, potions)

### Achievement

Represents a player achievement with:
- Identification and descriptive info
- Unlock status and date
- Progress tracking
- Reward information

### PlayerTitle

Represents a title/rank that can be equipped:
- Identification and descriptive info
- Unlock status and date
- Category and bonus effects

### BattleRecord

Records details of a completed battle:
- Battle participants and outcome
- Combat statistics (damage, spells cast)
- Date and rewards

## State Management

The `GameStateContext` provides a central store for the player profile data, with:

- **State** - Contains the complete player profile with stats, achievements, titles, and battle history
- **Reducers** - Handle state updates for different actions like unlocking achievements or adding battle records
- **Actions** - Methods to trigger state changes from components
- **Persistence** - Methods for saving and loading profile data

### Example Usage

```tsx
// Inside a component
const { state, actions } = useGameState();

// Get player stats
const playerLevel = state.playerStats.level;

// Update player stats
actions.updatePlayerStats({
  gold: state.playerStats.gold + 100,
  spellsLearned: state.playerStats.spellsLearned + 1
});

// Unlock an achievement
actions.unlockAchievement("achievement_123");

// Save profile data
actions.saveProfileData();
```

## Achievement Service

The `AchievementService` contains logic for detecting when achievements should be unlocked based on player actions and stats. It:

- Checks for achievements based on player stats
- Processes battle results for combat achievements
- Parses achievement descriptions to extract requirements
- Triggers achievement unlocks when conditions are met

### Example Usage

```tsx
// Inside a component
const achievementService = useAchievementService();

// Check for any newly unlocked achievements
achievementService.checkAchievements();

// Process a completed battle
const battleRecord = {
  // battle details
};
achievementService.handleBattleComplete(battleRecord);
```

## Notification System

The notification system provides feedback when achievements are unlocked or titles are earned. It:

- Manages a queue of notifications
- Shows animated notifications
- Auto-dismisses after a delay
- Supports different notification types (achievements, titles)

### Example Usage

```tsx
// Inside a component
const notifications = useNotifications();

// Show achievement notification
notifications.showAchievementNotification(achievement);

// Show title unlock notification
notifications.showTitleUnlockNotification(title);
```

## UI Components

### PlayerProfileScreen

The main container component that:
- Provides tabbed navigation
- Handles switching between profile views
- Manages profile data export

### StatsSummary

Displays player statistics in a grid format with:
- Game progress stats
- Character stats
- Combat statistics
- Achievement summary
- Title information
- Inventory stats

### AchievementList

Shows achievements with:
- Filtering by unlocked/locked status
- Progress indication
- Reward information
- Unlock dates

### BattleHistoryLog

Displays battle records with:
- Filtering by outcome
- Chronological sorting
- Detailed battle statistics
- Rewards information

### TitleRankDisplay

Manages player titles with:
- Filtering by unlocked/locked status
- Title equipping functionality
- Bonus information
- Category organization

## Data Persistence

Profile data is saved to the browser's `localStorage` with:

- Save/load tied to user ID and save ID
- Auto-saving after significant changes
- Exportable JSON data
- Auto-loading when the profile is opened

### Save Format

```javascript
{
  playerName: "Wizard Name",
  playerStats: {
    // Player statistics
  },
  achievements: [
    // Achievement objects
  ],
  battleHistory: [
    // Battle record objects
  ],
  titles: [
    // Title objects
  ],
  equippedTitleId: "title_123"
}
```

## Integration with Gameplay

During gameplay, the profile system should be updated at these key moments:

1. **Battles** - Record battle outcomes and update combat stats
2. **Level-ups** - Update level, experience and check for new achievements
3. **Item Acquisition** - Update collection stats
4. **Spell Learning** - Update spell counts and check for related achievements
5. **Chapter Completion** - Update game progress stats

### Example Integration with Battle System

```tsx
// In the battle completion handler
const handleBattleComplete = (battleResult) => {
  // Create a battle record
  const battleRecord = {
    id: generateUniqueId(),
    enemyName: enemy.name,
    outcome: battleResult.victory ? 'victory' : 'defeat',
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    // other battle stats
  };
  
  // Use the achievement service to process the battle
  achievementService.handleBattleComplete(battleRecord);
  
  // Continue with other game logic
  // ...
};
```

## Testing and Debugging

The system includes mock data for testing in `mockProfileData.ts`, providing:

- Sample player stats
- Pre-defined achievements in various states
- Example titles
- Sample battle history

This allows testing the profile UI and notification system without having to manually trigger all conditions.

## Performance Considerations

- Achievements are only checked when relevant stats change, not on every state update
- Battle history is displayed with pagination to handle large histories
- Export functionality processes data on-demand rather than keeping formatted exports in memory

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to consider:

1. **Server Persistence** - Store profiles on a server for cross-device access
2. **Social Sharing** - Allow sharing achievements to social media
3. **Leaderboards** - Compare stats with other players
4. **Achievement Categories** - Group achievements by theme or difficulty
5. **Enhanced Visualizations** - Add charts and graphs for stat tracking
6. **Achievement Hints** - Provide clues for locked achievements

## Conclusion

The player profile system provides a complete framework for tracking player progress, recognizing achievements, and adding personalization through titles. The implementation is modular and can be extended as the game evolves with new content and features.
