# Wizard's Choice - Sequential Implementation Plan

1. [x] Create list of all files in src/js/* directories
2. [x] Verify that all functionality in src/js/* is already present in corresponding src/game/* files
3. [x] Find and update all import statements throughout the codebase to reference src/game/* paths instead of src/js/* paths
4. [x] Test application to ensure all functionality works after import path updates
5. [x] Remove all src/js/* directories and files after verifying functionality
6. [x] Update build process to reflect the consolidated structure
7. [x] Define import standards (e.g., absolute vs. relative paths)
8. [x] Update all import paths to follow the defined standard
9. [x] Split EnhancedSpellSystem.js into:
   - [x] SpellDefinitions.js - spell catalog and attributes
   - [x] SpellHandManager.js - deck and hand management
   - [x] SpellProgressionTracker.js - unlocking and improvement
10. [x] Update imports for the new modular spell system
11. [x] Split GameManager.js into:
    - [x] BattleManager.js - battle flow and turn processing
    - [x] PlayerManager.js - player state and actions
    - [x] GameStateManager.js - overall game state
12. [x] Update imports for the new modular game management system
13. [x] Refactor EnhancedUIManager.js into:
    - [x] ScreenManager.js - screen transitions
    - [x] UIElementManager.js - UI element creation and updating
    - [x] UIEventManager.js - event handling for UI elements
14. [x] Update imports for the new modular UI system
15. [x] Fix missing method errors after refactoring (initPlayerSpells)
16. [x] Identify unused functions and variables using static analysis
17. [x] Remove or comment unused code after verifying with the user this is intentionally unused code.
18. [x] Remove commented-out code that is no longer needed
19. [x] Identify and remove duplicate logic across components
    - [x] Removed duplicate initPlayerSpells method from EnhancedSpellSystem.js
    - [x] Consolidated initialization logic in SpellProgressionTracker.js
    - [x] Simplified resetPlayerProgress to reuse initPlayerProgress logic
