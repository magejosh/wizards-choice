# Wizard's Choice - Sequential Implementation Plan

1. [x] Create list of all files in src/js/* directories
2. [x] Verify that all functionality in src/js/* is already present in corresponding src/game/* files
3. [x] Find and update all import statements throughout the codebase to reference src/game/* paths instead of src/js/* paths
4. [x] Test application to ensure all functionality works after import path updates
5. [x] Remove all src/js/* directories and files after verifying functionality
6. [x] Update build process to reflect the consolidated structure
7. [ ] Define import standards (e.g., absolute vs. relative paths)
8. [ ] Update all import paths to follow the defined standard
9. [ ] Split EnhancedSpellSystem.js into:
   - [ ] SpellDefinitions.js - spell catalog and attributes
   - [ ] SpellHandManager.js - deck and hand management
   - [ ] SpellProgressionTracker.js - unlocking and improvement
10. [ ] Update imports for the new modular spell system
11. [ ] Split GameManager.js into:
    - [ ] BattleManager.js - battle flow and turn processing
    - [ ] PlayerManager.js - player state and actions
    - [ ] GameStateManager.js - overall game state
12. [ ] Update imports for the new modular game management system
13. [ ] Refactor EnhancedUIManager.js into:
    - [ ] ScreenManager.js - screen transitions
    - [ ] UIElementManager.js - UI element creation and updating
    - [ ] UIEventManager.js - event handling for UI elements
14. [ ] Update imports for the new modular UI system
15. [ ] Identify unused functions and variables using static analysis
16. [ ] Remove or comment unused code
17. [ ] Remove commented-out code that is no longer needed
18. [ ] Identify and remove duplicate logic across components
19. [ ] Optimize large functions by breaking them into smaller, focused functions
20. [ ] Apply consistent code style across all files
21. [ ] Design level-up animation storyboard
22. [ ] Create CSS keyframes for level-up animation
23. [ ] Implement level-up notification with animation in UIManager
24. [ ] Design experience gain animation storyboard
25. [ ] Create CSS keyframes for experience gain animation
26. [ ] Implement experience gain animation in ProgressionSystem
27. [ ] Connect animation triggers to relevant game events
28. [ ] Test animations on different screen sizes
29. [ ] Optimize animation performance
30. [ ] Profile application to identify performance bottlenecks
31. [ ] Optimize ThreeJS rendering in SceneManager
32. [ ] Implement asset preloading for faster transitions
33. [ ] Optimize spell effect animations for better performance
34. [ ] Implement memory management improvements
35. [ ] Test and optimize for mobile devices
36. [ ] Add performance monitoring metrics
37. [ ] Update code documentation with new modular structure
38. [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions in refactored files
39. [ ] Update user guide with clear instructions on spell selection
40. [ ] Add visual guides to user documentation
41. [ ] Create debugging section in documentation
42. [ ] Document common issues and their solutions
43. [ ] Update deployment guide with new build process
44. [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation
45. [ ] Update process maps to reflect new structure
