- After making changes, Never start the server for the USER unless explicitly asked to do so
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code unless required for proper modularization
- When problem-solving and bug-fixing, identify the root cause rather than working around it
- Do not drastically change the patterns before trying to iterate on existing patterns
- Always prefer simple solutions that fix the problem without breaking features/functionality
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means searching other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task without explaining why you need to AND Asking USER Permission.
- Prefer well known libraries when possible over custom solutions, like shadcn for UI components
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
